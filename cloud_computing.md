# 🌥️ CLOUD COMPUTING

# **Introduction 🧑‍💻**

Nowadays, Cloud computing ☁️ is adopted by every company, whether it is an MNC or a startup many are still migrating towards it because of the cost-cutting, lesser maintenance, and the increased capacity of the data with the help of servers maintained by the cloud providers.

One more reason for this drastic change from the On-premises servers of the companies to the Cloud providers is the ‘**Pay as you go 💵**’ principle-based services provided by them i.e., you only have to pay for the service which you are using. The disadvantage On-premises server holds is that if the server is not in use the company still has to pay for it.

# What is Cloud Computing 💻☁️?
Cloud computing is a technology that enables the delivery of computing resources—such as servers 🖥️, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the internet ("the cloud") on a pay-as-you-go 💵 basis. Instead of maintaining physical infrastructure, businesses and individuals can use remote servers 🌍 hosted by cloud providers to store data, run applications, and perform computing tasks.

This approach offers several advantages, including scalability, flexibility, cost efficiency, and security. Cloud services are typically categorized into three main models: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) 🏗️, Platform as a Service (PaaS) 🛠️, and Software as a Service (SaaS) 📲, each catering to different computing needs. Popular cloud providers like **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, and **Microsoft Azure** offer a wide range of services, enabling businesses to innovate faster, improve collaboration, and enhance reliability without the burden of managing on-premise hardware.

Cloud computing has revolutionized industries by supporting modern applications like AI 🤖, big data analytics, IoT, and remote work solutions, making it an essential technology in today’s digital era.

# **Advantages of Cloud Computing ✅🚀**:

The following are main advantages of Cloud Computing:

**🌍 Cost Efficiency**

- Pay-as-you-go Model: Reduces capital expenditure, especially for small and medium-sized businesses.

- No Upfront Costs: Eliminates the need to purchase expensive hardware.

**📈 Flexibility and Scalability**

- Resources can be scaled up or down based on demand.

- Businesses can handle varying workloads without large investments in infrastructure.

**👥 Collaboration and Accessibility**

- Cloud services allow access from anywhere with an internet connection.

- Encourages teamwork through real-time collaboration on shared documents and projects.

**🔄 Automatic Maintenance and Updates**

- Cloud providers handle infrastructure maintenance and software updates.

- Ensures access to the latest technologies without manual intervention.



#
# **Disadvantages of Cloud Computing ⚠️❌**

The following are the main disadvantages of Cloud Computing:

**🔒 Security Concerns**

- Storing sensitive data on external servers raises security and privacy issues.

**⚠️ Downtime and Reliability**

- Unexpected outages due to network issues, server failures, or maintenance can disrupt operations.

**🌐 Dependency on Internet Connectivity**

- Requires a stable and high-speed internet connection to access cloud services.

- Users in areas with poor connectivity may face accessibility challenges.

**💰 Cost Management Complexity**

- Although the pay-as-you-go model is beneficial, improper resource management can lead to unexpected expenses.

- Organizations need to continuously monitor usage to avoid excessive costs.

#
# **🛠️ Key Concepts**
**1️⃣ On-Demand Self-Service ⚙️**

- Users can access cloud resources (e.g., storage, computing power) without human intervention.

**2️⃣ Broad Network Access 🌐**

- Cloud services are available over the internet from various devices, including computers, smartphones, and tablets.

**3️⃣ Resource Pooling 🎭**

- Cloud providers use a multi-tenant model, dynamically allocating resources to multiple users as needed.

**4️⃣ Rapid Elasticity 📊**

- Resources can be scaled dynamically based on demand, ensuring efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

**5️⃣ Measured Service 📏**

- Users are billed based on their resource consumption (e.g., storage, bandwidth, computing power).




### Cloud Based Services


## CLOUD SERVICE PROVIDER
A cloud service provider, or CSP, is a company that offers components of cloud computing -- typically, infrastructure as a service (IaaS), software as a service (SaaS) or platform as a service (PaaS).
